## What is Poppins?

Poppins is a [manifesto](MANIFESTO.md) that emphasizes the importance of having entire open source projects focused on helping first-time contributors get involved with open source development. A project is considered a "Poppins project" if it is managed with the primary goal of helping **beginners** to level up their skills and increase their experience with OSS in an atmosphere defined by community and **mentorship**. Poppins projects have a slower development pace than production-level projects, and are not necessarily focused on making the best software out there. Instead, they aim to help beginners make their first open source contributions, thereby exposing them to the main aspects of how to build good OSS in a healthy community.

Projects created with this purpose may use the Poppins badge <img src="badge-poppins.svg" alt="Poppins"> to identify them as a good place for beginners to make their first contributions and learn how OSS development works.

Poppins is **heavily inspired** by the beautiful [First Timers Only](https://www.firsttimersonly.com) site. So, if you are looking for more resources for beginners, head to https://www.firsttimersonly.com and find some! =)

To build a Poppins project, follow the [Manifesto Principles and Guidelines](MANIFESTO.md).

## Trivia

The name is inspired by the [Pamela Lyndon Travers (P. L. Travers)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P._L._Travers) character and Disney movies **Mary Poppins**, the magical nanny that shows two neglected children that the world is a fascinating place ready to be explored. While mentoring the kids, **Mary Poppins** demonstrates affection, knowledge, experience, skill (magic), intelligence, fun and discipline. 

So, that's the inspiration for Poppins: **to bring to life projects that help beginners learn how to explore the open source world with excitement, intelligence, fun and discipline.**

## What is Poppins?

Poppins is a [manifesto](MANIFESTO.md) that states the importance of having entire open source projects focused on beginners and first contributors and how to do so. A project is considerate a "Poppins project" if it is mainly managed to help **beginners** to level up their skills and increase their experience with OSS in a **mentorship** community atmosphere. Poppins projects have a slower development pace and are not focused on making the best software out there, instead it aims to help beginners make their first contributions following a mentor-based learning approach, covering the main aspects of how to build a good OSS in a healthy community.

Projects created with this purpose may use the Poppins badge <img src="badge-poppins.svg" alt="Poppins"> to identify them as a good place for beginners to make their first contributions and learn how the OSS development works for real.

Poppins is **heavily inspired** by the beautiful [First Timers Only](https://www.firsttimersonly.com). So, if you are looking for more resources for beginners, head to https://www.firsttimersonly.com and find some! =)

To build a Poppins project, follow the [Manifesto Principles and Guidelines](MANIFESTO.md) and have fun. =)

## Trivia

The name is inspired by the [Pamela Lyndon Travers (P. L. Travers)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P._L._Travers) character and Disney movies **Mary Poppins**, the magical nanny that shows to two neglected children how the world can be a fascinating place ready to be explored with excitement. During the mentoring process of the kids, **Mary Poppins** demonstrates affection, knowledge, experience, skill (magic), intelligence, fun and discipline. 

So, that's the inspiration for Poppins: **to bring projects that help beginners learn how to explore the open source world with excitement, intelligence, fun and discipline.**
